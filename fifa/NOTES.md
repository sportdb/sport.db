## Confederations

Six confederations and 211 national associations

Teams which are either members of Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA),
the world's football governing body (211 teams),
or have membership in a FIFA-affiliated continental confederation without being members of FIFA (12 teams).


Besides its worldwide institutions there are six confederations recognised by FIFA which oversee the game in the different continents and regions of the world. National associations, and not the continental confederations, are members of FIFA.
The continental confederations are provided for in FIFA's statutes,
and membership of a confederation is a prerequisite to FIFA membership.

- Asian Football Confederation (AFC; 47 members) (b)
- Confederation of African Football (CAF; 56 members)
- Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF; 41 members) (c)
- Confederación Sudamericana de Fútbol (CONMEBOL; 10 members)
- Oceania Football Confederation (OFC; 14 members)(b)
- Union of European Football Associations (UEFA; 55 members) (d)


(b) Australia has been a member of the AFC since 2006.

(c) French Guiana, Guyana and Suriname are CONCACAF members although they are in South America. The French Guiana team is a member of CONCACAF but not of FIFA.

(d) Teams representing the nations of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Cyprus, Georgia, Israel, Kazakhstan, Russia and Turkey are UEFA members, although the majority or entirety of their territory is outside of continental Europe. Monaco is not member of UEFA or FIFA.
