q: is match half an english word in use?

a: No, "match half" is not a common or standard phrase in English. It seems like it could be a combination of two words ("match" and "half"), but it doesn't have a specific meaning or usage as a single expression.

q: how about football match half?

a: The phrase "football match half" could refer to one of the two halves of a football (soccer) match. In football, the game is divided into two equal halves, typically lasting 45 minutes each, with a break in between.

A more common way to phrase it would be:

- **First half** (referring to the first 45 minutes of the match)
- **Second half** (referring to the last 45 minutes of the match)

"Football match half" isn't typically used as a standalone term, but in context, it's understood that you're referring to one part of the game, either the first or second half. 

For example:
- "The score at halftime (the break between the first and second halves) was 1-0."
