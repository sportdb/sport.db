# Notes


```
search club with or without unaccent to normalize ???
 no match - retry with unaccented variant if different
        e.g. example is Preussen Münster  (with mixed accent and unaccented letters) that would go unmatched for now
         Preussen Münster => preussenmünster (norm) 
                           => preussenmunster (norm+unaccent)
    
      todo/fix - make always use norm+unaccent ?? rebuild names
                          always add all unaccent veriants  -  why? why not?
