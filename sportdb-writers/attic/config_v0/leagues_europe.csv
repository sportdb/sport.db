##
## By 1968, all UEFA member nations had set up domestic cup competitions
## due to the success of the Cup Winners' Cup. UEFA regarded it as
## the second most prestigious competition,
## behind the European Cup (later the UEFA Champions League)
## and ahead of the Fairs Cup (later the UEFA Cup).
## Therefore, a team qualified for both the European Cup
## and the Cup Winners' Cup would play in the European Cup,
## whereas a team qualified for both the UEFA Cup and the Cup Winners' Cup
## would play in the Cup Winners' Cup.
## Nevertheless, many commentators and fans regarded the Cup Winners' Cup
## as weaker than the UEFA Cup, which had more and better teams
## from the stronger European leagues.

## old "2-nd" tier cup (merged into uefa cup)
##    renamed the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1994/95
